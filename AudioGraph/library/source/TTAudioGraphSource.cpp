 * @brief Represents one connection between two AudioGraph objects
 *
 * @details TTAudioGraphSource is an upstream connection from a #TTAudioGraphInlet of a #TTAudioGraphObject to a "TTAudioGraphOutlet of an upstream #TTAudioGraphObject.
 * The relationship of a source to other parts of the audio graph hierarchy is as follows:
 *
 * - A graph may have many objects.
 * - An object may have many inlets.
 * - An inlet may have many signals (sources) connected.
 * - A signal may have many channels.
