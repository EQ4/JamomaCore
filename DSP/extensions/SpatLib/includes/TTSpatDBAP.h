 * @brief Jamoma DSP SpatLib renderer based on Distance-based amplitude panning (DBAP)
 *
 * @details DBAP permits sinks (speakers) to be positioned any way you want. 
 * Speaker configurations are not limited to circles/spheres surrounding a sweet spot, but can be used e.g. to locate speakers in several adjecent spaces.
 * DBAP is matrix-based and ensures equal intensity while adjusting gains to each of the sinks in such a way that relative gain diminish with increasing distance from source to sink.
 * The exact rolloff rate (in dB) can be controlled with the rolloff attribute of the #TTSpatDBAPRenderer class.
 *
 * @todo: Extend with a solution for interpolating to new matrix coefficients

/*
 
The following are development notes while developing TTSpatDBAP starting of from the source files foir TTSpatSnap:
 
 DIFFERENCES WITH SNAP :
 
 - sources need a width
 - renderer needs to implement a global rolloff
 - weight coefficient to be associated with each source-sink pair (a matrix)
